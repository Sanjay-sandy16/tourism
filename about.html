    <p>Kerala is famous for its unique geography, tranquil backwaters, unspoiled beaches, art forms and spices. It is also famous for its charming houseboats, sprawling tea plantations, unique eco-tourism, magnificent architecture, Ayurvedic treatments and unforgettable culinary experiences.
<br>
<br>
Kerala is correctly referred to as ‘God’s Own Country;. Its all-encompassing geography that comprises of serene hill stations and tranquil beaches will mesmerize you.

It is a tropical paradise with an extremely pleasant climate. You can choose to paddle in the peaceful backwaters, go for a trek across the Western Ghats, or witness the calming mists of the hills. Its pristine nature will baffle you. Kerala has an endless list of festivals to catch up on; needless to say, it is a riot of experiences.

<br>
Kerala falls in the Southern part of India and has a unique geography. It is home to luscious green hills, valleys, mesmerizing waterfalls, serene backwaters, and beautiful beaches.

You can have a relaxing time in the exotic hill stations or go for a safari in the wildlife sanctuaries. You can also have an unforgettable time on the pristine golden beaches.
It is undoubtedly one of the most photographer-friendly destinations in Kerala. It leans more towards the commercial side and is a large-scale supplier of spices internationally!

That said, you certainly have to go on a shopping spree to carry back home the most authentic spices, sandalwood, and perfumes from Kochi. Other than this, it has numerous scenic spots; the Dutch Palace and Wazhachal Falls being the most popular.
<br>
<br>
The houseboats were certainly one of my personal favorites in Kerala! These dot the frequently mentioned backwaters of the region. You will be surprised when you enter these slowly moving barges. They offer all the comforts of a hotel room, if not more!

Alappuzha is also known as the ‘Venice of the East’ and it offers the best houseboat experiences. I assure you that you will see nature from a different perspective when you are on a houseboat. It will give you a view of some of the inaccessible rural areas of Kerala as well.
